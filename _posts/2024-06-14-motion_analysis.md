# Motion & Definition
In areas with a significant amount of illegal trade and production of drugs, THBT The state should legalise and aggressively produce and sell drugs.

# Analysis (Gov)

## Problems
1. Monopoly of drug cartels
2. Waste of untrackable business (will not affect capital gain)
3. Lack of control over quality and drug violence

## Key Actors
1. Existing drug distributor
2. Citizen 
3. People who involved actively in the business either as customers, suppliers, or maybe producers.
4. Government bodies s.t defend the state

## Ideas
* Legalize drugs will not affects the usage of drugs. Since the state is in a significant amount of illegal trade, the consumer should have known before. The difference would be just legal and illegal. Even if there's a new consumer, they wouldn't be that much as the recent consumer
* Accountability of government in the drugs distribution
* Changes in the society after legalisation of drugs
(elaborate how the citizen would be)
